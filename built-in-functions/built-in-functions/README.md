# Built-In Functions



###  OPA Built-in Functions

build.security's PDPs support all the built-in functions documented in the Open Policy Agent [wiki](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#built-in-functions).

### build.security's builtin functions

In addition, build.security's PDP also supports built-in functions that are not part of the vanilla OPA project \(though we're working on getting them out there!\).

* [build.query\_raw](build.query_raw/)
* [build.geo\_from\_ip](build.geo_from_ip.md)

**Need more help?**

Feel free to open a support technical assistant ticket to build.security support team in our [support portal](https://build-security.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals) and we'll guide you on how to use those examples and make them tailor-made to your use case. If the function you are looking for is not found- you can also open a feature request and we'll update you when it's ready.
