# Deleting a Policy



Deleting a policy is very easy to do, but can have serious consequences. When you delete a policy, all policy settings, rules and definitions that were created for it are also deleted. Once done, it cannot be undone.

**To delete a policy**

* In the Policies section of the navigation panel, click the wrench icon located beside the policy you wish to delete. The Policy Settings panel opens.
