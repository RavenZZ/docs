# Defining a New Data Source

A data source is defined as any source for information that supplies the Policy Decision Point with the relevant data in real-time according to the policy rules that you have defined. Currently, build.security enables you to create new data sources as follows:

* [Create a new internal data source](new-internal-data-source.md)
* [Create a new Elasticsearch data source](new-elasticsearch-data-source.md)
* [Create a new PostgreSQL data source](new-postgresql-data-source.md)
* [Create a new Dynamo data source](new-dynamodb-data-source.md)
* [Create a new MySQL data source](new-mysql-data-source.md)

build.security also offers the ability to create your own internal data source file and build the JSON file according to your needs within the build.security control plane.
