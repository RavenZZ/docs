# Internal Audit

When you select Internal Audit, the audit screen displays a list of all actions that have occurred within the current project.

build.security maintains a complete audit log of all actions performed in the system, either from the user interface or by an API call. You can click the expand arrow to show more details of each action.

For each action, the following details are listed:

* Timestamp: UTC value of when the action was performed.
* User: name of user who initiated the action.
* Action
* Operation
* Object type
* Name
* Internal object ID

When you expand a line in the audit log, based on the type of operation performed, additional information will be displayed.
