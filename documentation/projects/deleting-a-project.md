# Deleting a Project

You can delete a project from the [Project Settings](../project-settings/) screen.

**To delete a project:**

1. On the project settings screen, select **Manage Project** \(the default option when the screen is opened\).
2. Below the project name and description fields, click **DELETE**.
3. Because this action cannot be undone, you are asked to enter the word **DELETE** in the field and then click the **CONFIRM DELETE** button.
