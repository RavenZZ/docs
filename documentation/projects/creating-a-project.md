# Creating a Project



A project can be considered your workspace, the place where you will create, manage, and evaluate your authorization policy. Within a project, you can manage the project's data sources, policy decision points, policies and rules. You can also manage the project settings.

**To create a new project:**

1. On the [project selection screen](project-selection-screen.md), scroll below existing projects to locate the blank project box.
2. Click in the box and in the **Project name** field, enter the name of the new project.
3. In the **Project description** field, enter a short description \(optional\).
4. Click **Create.** A confirmation message will appear, confirming that the project was successfully created.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Every project must have a unique name. If you attempt to create a new project with the same name as an existing one, an error message will appear, and the project will not be created.
{% endhint %}

Once you have created the project itself, you can begin to configure the project by defining the following:

* [Define Data sources](../data-sources/)
* [Build a policy](../policies/)
* [Define and deploy Policy Decision Points](../policy-decision-points-pdp/)
* [Configure project settings](../project-settings/)
