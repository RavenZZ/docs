# Project Selection Screen

The **Project Selection** screen appears after you log in or when you select **Switch Project** from the user avatar icon on the toolbar. This screen displays all currently defined projects that are available to you based on your admin role. Some roles will have access to all the projects, some will have access to a limited amount or even to one. For users that have access to only one project, when they log in, the control plane for that account will be displayed.

### Available Actions

On the project selection screen, you can:

* Select an existing project to view, update, delete, etc.
* Search for your project by entering part or all of the project name in the search field.
* Create a new project.
