# Editing a PDP Configuration

It is possible to edit or change several different elements related to PDPs, including: the PDP name and description, the deployment instructions for the PDP, and also change the current API key at any time.

* **To edit the PDP name and description:** Click the kebab \(three vertical dots\) on the right of the PDP you would like to edit. Then, click Edit \(the pencil icon\) to update the PDP name and/or description.

To access the configuration of a specific PDP, click the down arrow beside the PDP. This will expand the selected PDP. In this area, you can perform the following tasks:

* Delete the existing API key by selected the kebab and then click **Delete**. You can then generate a new one.
* Remove one or more PDPs from the list in the control plane by clicking the trash icon beside the PDP you wish to remove.
* Copy the deployment instructions by clicking the copy icon on the right of the box. You can then modify these before using it in the command line.
