### First Login

If this is your first time logging in, check your mailbox for an invitation from "build.security [no-reply@build.security](mailto:no-reply@build.security)". This was sent to you automatically when you were added to the build.security platform.

The email you received provides you with all the information you need in order to access build.security for the first time. Users that are not authenticated using Single sign-on will be asked to create a new password.
