# Logging In

Each time you enter the build.security platform, you will need to log in. There are several methods for logging into the system:

* [logging in with email address and password](logging-in-1.md) \(your build.security credentials\).
* [logging in with single sign-on \(SSO\)](../../system-settings/single-sign-on.md).
* [logging in with social provider authentication](using-social-provider-authentication.md)

**Note**

If you do not know which option to use, contact your system administrator.

### First Login

If this is your first time logging in, check your mailbox for an invitation from "build.security [no-reply@build.security](mailto:no-reply@build.security)". This email was sent to you automatically when you were added to the build.security platform.

The email provides you with all the information you need to access build.security for the first time. Users that are not authenticated using Single sign-on will be asked to create a new password.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Password**

Enter a secure password \(using at least one lower case letter, at least one upper case letter, at least one number, and at least one special character, etc.\).

If you are unable to log in, contact your administrator to reset your password or contact- [support@build.security](mailto:support@build.security).
