# Logging In

Each time you enter the build.security platform, you will need to log in. There are several methods for logging into the system:

* [logging in with email address and password](logging-in-1.md) \(your build.security credentials\).
* [logging in with single sign-on \(SSO\)](../../system-settings/single-sign-on.md).

**Note**

If you do not know which option to use, contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}
