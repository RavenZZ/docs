# Defining a New Data Source

A data source is defined as any source for information that supplies the Policy Decision Point with the relevant data in real-time according to the policy rules that you have defined. Currently, build.security enables you to define the following types of data sources: 

* [Internal data source](new-internal-data-source.md)
* [Elasticsearch data source](new-elasticsearch-data-source.md)
* [PostgreSQL data source](new-postgresql-data-source.md)
* [DynamoDB data source](new-dynamodb-data-source.md)
* [MySQL data source](new-mysql-data-source.md)

build.security also offers the ability to create your own internal data source file and build the JSON file according to your needs within the build.security control plane.
