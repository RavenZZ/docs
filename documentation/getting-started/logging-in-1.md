# Logging In



Each time you enter the build.security platform, you will need to log in. There are two methods for logging into the system:

* logging in with email address and password \(your build.security credentials\).
* [logging in with single sign-on \(SSO\)](../../system-settings/single-sign-on.md).

**Note**

If you do not know which option to use, contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

### Log in with build.security credentials

1. In the **Email** field, enter your email address.
2. In the **Password** field, enter your password.
3. Click **log in**.

### Log in using Single Sign-On

1. On the login page, click **Continue with Single Sign-on**. The SSO login page appears.
2. Enter your email address.
3. Click **log in** to confirm your credentials. The page will re-direct for authentication and then you will enter the build.security platform.

Note: If your organization does not require SSO login and you still select this option, an error message will appear on the login page. Contact your system admin for further assistance.

**Possible Errors**

If you are unable to log in, contact your administrator to reset your password or contact- [support@build.security](mailto:support@build.security).
{% endhint %}

More details on User Management can be found In [System Settings](../../system-settings/).

### First Login

If this is your first time logging in, check your mailbox for an invitation from "build.security [no-reply@build.security](mailto:no-reply@build.security)". This was sent to you automatically when you were added to the build.security platform.

The email you received provides you with all the information you need in order to access build.security for the first time. Users that are not authenticated using Single sign-on will be asked to create a new password.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Password**

Enter a secure password \(using at least one lower case letter, at least one upper case letter, at least one number, and at least one special character, etc.\).

If you are unable to log in, contact your administrator to reset your password or contact- [support@build.security](mailto:support@build.security).
