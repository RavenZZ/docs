# Control Plane Overview

The control plane is where you will interface with the build.security platform. This includes defining and integrating build.security with your data sources, PDPs, and PEPs. Creating your authorization policies and monitoring the authorization decisions.

The control plane is divided into the following areas:

* [Navigation panel ](navigation-panel-options.md)on the left enables you to access each of the main elements in the build.security system
* [Toolbar](main-toolbar.md) at the top
* Main display area where you will configure, monitor, and manage all the elements that go into creating and manage your authorization policies.
