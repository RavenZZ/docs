# Creating a New PDP Configuration

On the Policy Decision Point screen, you can define new PDP configurations. Note that each PDP defined in the project must have a unique name.

**To configure a new PDP:**

1. From the control plane menu, select **Policy Decision Points**. The Policy Decision Points screen opens.
2. In the lower right side of the screen, click **+ New**. The New Policy Decision Point opens.
3. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the PDP.
4. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the new PDP \(optional\).
5. Click **Save** to create the new PDP.

Once you create the PDP configuration, you should [generate a PDP key and secret ](https://docs.build.security/docs/generate-keys-for-a-pdp-instance)for it.
