# Creating a project



A project can be considered your workspace, the place where you will create, manage, and evaluate your authorization policy. Within a project, you can manage the project's data sources, policy decision points, policies and rules. You can also manage the project settings.

**To create a new project:**

1. On the [project selection screen](https://docs.build.security/docs/project-management-screen), scroll below existing projects to locate the blank project box.
2. Click in the box and in the **Project name** field, enter the name of the new project.
3. In the **Project description** field, enter a short description \(optional\).
4. Click **Create.** A confirmation message will appear, confirming that the project was successfully created.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Every project must have a unique name. If you attempt to create a new project with the same name as an existing one, an error message will appear, and the project will not be created.
{% endhint %}

Once you have created the project itself, you can begin to configure the project by defining the following:

* [Define data sources](https://docs.build.security/docs/defining-a-new-data-source)
* [Define Policy Decision Points](https://docs.build.security/docs/define-new-pdp-configuration)
* [Integrate Policy Enforcement Points](https://docs.build.security/docs/policy-enforcement-points-peps)
* [Configure project settings](https://docs.build.security/docs/manage-your-projects)
* [Build a policy](https://docs.build.security/docs/building-policies)
