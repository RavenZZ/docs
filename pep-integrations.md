# PEP Integrations

### Introduction

The Policy Enforcement Point \(AKA PEP\) is responsible for managing all the requests and enforcing the decisions made by the PDP.

The PEP can be your application implementing one of build.security middlewares, or a proxy that handles requests between applications.

* **Node.js** [github](https://github.com/build-security/pdp-docker-authz)
* **Java Spring** [github](https://github.com/build-security/opa-java-spring-client/tree/main/example)
