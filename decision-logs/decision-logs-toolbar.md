# Decision Logs Toolbar

Just above the decision logs table, on the right side, is the decision log toolbar. This contain:

* A **Refresh** option to ensure you have the most up-to-date information
* The **Show/Hide** filter toggle will show or hide the filter options bar above the table.

When you apply one or more filters to the decision logs table, the Show/Hide icon will display the number of filters currently set. As you clear the filters, the displayed number will automatically adjust to the current number of defined filters.
